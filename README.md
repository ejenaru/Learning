Learning
========
Here is where I'm going to save my learning process.

##About me

My name is Irene DÃ­az Fossaty and I have recently decided to make myself a developer.
I've allways used some of my free time to learn how to program simple things, make some easy 
games in RPG maker and practice in CTF events for fun. Nothing special.

I've studied Pscychology in MÃ¡laga, but 2020 have teached me some important things... 

_Do whatever you feel comfortable with._ 

And as The Zen of Python says...

>Now is better than never.
